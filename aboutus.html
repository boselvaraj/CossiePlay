<h1 style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Franklin Gothic Bold', 'Arial Black', sans-serif; font-weight: 300;">About Us</h1><br>

<p>CossiePlay  is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since  2012. We create outstanding custom-made costumes. Cosplayers can order any kind  of costume - from simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including  advanced features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working  force fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks  and cost between $10 and $10,000.<br>
  We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a  price list is available) as well.</p>
<p>On the first Saturday of every month we hold a  &ldquo;CossiePlay Party&rdquo; at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17  and kids under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow  stick. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at  the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not required).</p>
